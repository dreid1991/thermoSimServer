<p>So an ideal monatomic gas has a heat capacity is 1.5R, right?  This comes from an ideal monatomic gas molecules having 3 degrees of freedom.  By degrees of freedom, I mean ways in which it can move.  Each degree of freedom contributes 0.5 R to the total heat capacity because.  Temperature is an expression of how fast the thing is moving, so the more degrees of freedom into which we can shove energy, the more energy we can shove in before we reach some speed.</p><p>So the three degrees for our monatomic gas are moving in X, Y, and Z.  3*0.5R gives us 1.5 R. </p><p>What if we have a diatomic gas like O<sub>2</sub>?  Now our molecule can spin in two directions!  This gives us two more degrees of freedom for a heat capacity of 2.5 R. </p><p>Now how about the simulation’s gas?  It exists is two dimensions, right?  That means we only have two degrees of freedom for a heat capacity of 2*0.5R = R.</p>
